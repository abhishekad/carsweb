            <p>It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If you're a programmer who's working on a project
                where blocks of text are needed, this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to test your programming and that the tool being created is working well.

                Above are a few examples of how the random paragraph generator can be beneficial.
                The best way to see if this random paragraph picker will be useful for your intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number of paragraphs to see if they are beneficial to your current project.
                
                If you do find this paragraph tool useful, please do us a favor and let us know how you're using it. It's greatly beneficial for us to know the different ways this tool is being used so we can improve it with updates.
                This is especially true since there are times when the generators 
                we create get used in completely unanticipated ways from when we initially created them. If you have the time, please send us a quick note on what you'd like to see changed or added to make it better in the future.
            </p>
            <p>A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete.
                By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first place.

                Beginning Writing Routine
                Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning.
                The purpose here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.
                
                Writing Challenge
                Another writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the random paragraph and incorporate a single sentence from that into a new paragraph to create a short story. 
                Unlike the random sentence generator, the sentences from the random paragraph will have some connection to one another so it will be a bit different. You also won't know exactly how many sentences will appear in the random paragraph.
